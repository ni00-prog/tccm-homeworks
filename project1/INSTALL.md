How to start using the code
===========================
The code uses TREXIO an opensource library of quantum chemical data, because of that is necessary, as first step, to install the library HDF5. This last one refers
to Hierarchical Data Format, a software and file format for manage, process and store of heterogenous data (in the following link the documentation is provided: https://support.hdfgroup.org/documentation/).
So, the first step, if Ubuntu is used, is to type in the terminal:
  
  `sudo apt install libhdf5-dev`

  or, if MacOS is used:

  `brew install hdf5`

  The next step is to dowload TREXIO, this can be done by using the following link: https://github.com/TREX-CoE/trexio/releases/download/v2.5.0/trexio-2.5.0.tar.gz
